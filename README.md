Hello, here I am logging my progress while learning JS through a Skillshare tutorial.

It is kinda random - but at the end of the day it is not meant to be a functional whole, but a mess of small wins.

Here are some tasks that I think are worth mentioning - from the first course:

1. [browser-calculator.html](course-01/browser-calculator.html)
2. [mini-project-02.html](course-01/mini-project-02.html)
3. [mini-project-04.html](course-01/mini-project-04.html)
4. [oop-modal.html](course-01/oop-modal.html)
5. [tip-calculator.html](course-01/tip-calculator.html)
6. [final-project.html](course-01/final-project.html)

And from the second course:

1. [rotate-on-scroll.html](course-02/rotate-on-scroll.html)
2. [will-it-palindrome.html](course-02/will-it-palindrome.html)
3. [simple-calculator.html](course-02/simple-calculator.html) YES, I KNOW, IT USES EVAL. AND YES, I KNOW NOT TO EVER USE IT BECAUSE IT IS A SECURITY HAZARD.
4. [loops-and-arrays.html](course-02/loops-and-arrays.html)

_*in no particular order_
