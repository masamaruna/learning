Hello, here I am logging my progress while learning JS through a Skillshare tutorial.

Here are some tasks that I think are worth mentioning - from the first course:

1. [browser-calculator.html](course-01/browser-calculator.html)
2. [mini-project-02.html](course-01/mini-project-02.html)
3. [mini-project-04.html](course-01/mini-project-04.html)
4. [oop-modal.html](course-01/oop-modal.html)
5. [tip-calculator.html](course-01/tip-calculator.html)
6. [final-project.html](course-01/final-project.html)

And from the second course:

*in no particular order*

My certificates (gotta catch them all like Pokemon):
